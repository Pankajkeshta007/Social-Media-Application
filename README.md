<h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT :</h1>
<p>The social media application is a modern platform designed to connect users through various forms of media 
sharing and real-time communication. Built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, 
this application provides a seamless user experience for registering, logging in, posting content, messaging, 
and creating reels.
Upon registration, users create unique login credentials, granting them access to the platform's features. Upon 
successful login, users are directed to the home page, where they can share photos and other media content. 
The messaging section enables real-time communication between users, facilitated by WebSocket technology 
for efficient and responsive message delivery.</p>
